I recently graduated from Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I now work for HPE as an ASIC Design Engineer where I am involved with designing next generation networking switches. Technically, I am most proficient with computer hardware modeling and software development.
